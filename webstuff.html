            <h3>HTML Info</h3>
            <p>HTML is the markup language that tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images for the user.  Each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag).  Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>

            <h3>CSS Info</h3>
            <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>

            <h3>JavaScript Info</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
